my idea is to develop a non-profit website like a charity website to help poor people by collecting donations.
By doing this website we can attract volunteers. so they can contact us easily. Finally we help orphans, and old age people.

For building purpose I would like to use the folling tools:

Code: GIT
Build: Maven, Docker, Ansible
Deployment: Jenkins, Docker, Ansible, kubernetes, 
Monitoring: Nagios, Grafana, splunk
