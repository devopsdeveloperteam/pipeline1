HI frineds Ihave an idea of a project.
I propose to create an app or website for calculating BMI and primary inputs should be weight and height either in metric scale system or imperial system. 
We also need to input sex and age of the person.
Additional attributes will be ethenicity of the person. This is because every region or continent has their own standards for an ideal BMI health.
